🚀 Real-Time Object Detection with FastAPI & YOLOv3

🎯 Live Detection. Smart Interface. Real Metrics.
This project brings together the speed of FastAPI and the accuracy of YOLOv3 to deliver a real-time object detection web app with a clean, user-friendly frontend. Whether you're experimenting with computer vision, deploying lightweight ML APIs, or demoing detection in your portfolio — this app gives you the tools to do it all.

🧠 Features That Make This Unique
✅ Live Webcam Detection — Detect objects in real-time through your browser.

✅ User-Controlled Camera — Start/stop the webcam on demand from the UI.

✅ Video Recording — Record your detection session and download it as a .avi file.

✅ Image Upload Support — Upload any image and detect objects with one click.

✅ Live Stats Overlay — Displays:

📦 Total objects detected

📈 Average confidence

🎞 FPS (Frame rate)

⏱ Detection time per frame

✅ Modern Frontend — Custom-designed HTML/CSS interface (no templates copied off the internet).

✅ Thread-safe Metrics — Uses threading locks to ensure stable stats across frames.
